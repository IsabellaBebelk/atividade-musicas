July 

Meeting up, like we're 17 again
Solo cups, but now we put beer in them
Laying back and daring me to
Dive into the deep end
Reaching out, how you been holding up?
'Cause I heard you'd recently broken up
With the boy you grew apart from
So much for your first love
And we laugh like little kids
Bad jokes for the hell of it
Mom says come inside, we say "In a minute"
But I wish that I could
Close my eyes, ignore the sirens
Watch the sun leave the horizon
We won't go unless we're dying
But we both know that time was never kind
And you know in July
Those summer nights belong to you and I
Moving out and counting the miles, this
Little town takes all of your breath with it
Fatal flaw, I'm sick of it all
But now that I'm leaving, I'm missing
All the late nights in
Let our deepest secrets slip
Holding tight, this was nice, wasn't it?
But I wish that I could
Close my eyes, ignore the sirens
Watch the sun leave the horizon
We won't go unless we're dying
But we both know that time was never kind
And you know in July
Those summer nights belong to you and I
Hold on a little longer
You're slipping through my fingers
The tide will pull us under
What's left of you will linger
Hold on a little longer
You're slipping through my fingers
The tide will pull us under
What's left of you will linger
But I wish I could
Close my eyes, ignore the sirens
Watch the sun leave the horizon
We won't go unless we're dying
But we both know that time was never kind
And you know in July
Those summer nights belong to you and I
