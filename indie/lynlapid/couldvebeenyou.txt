could've been you

You look so lovely covered in honey
You spilled a bit of cinnamon, but hey it's alright
We sneak little bites when the other isn't looking
And laughing when the evidence is easy to find

I swear you were all for me moments ago
All that's left is remnants of what's unexplored
I hope I'm wrong and it's not true
That if we played our cards right

It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah

We could've had weekends, the kind where we sleep in
I'm sifting through our messages for where it went wrong
You left with no warning, no trace in the morning
The storyline won't see the light, now that you're gone

I swear you were all for me moments ago
But the only part of you here is your ghost
I hope I'm wrong and it's not true
That if you stuck around

It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah

It could've been you, ah
And I wanted it so bad to be you
It could've been you, ah
And I wanted it so bad to be you
It could've been you, ah
And I wanted it so bad to be you
It could've been you, ah
And I wanted it

Could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah
It could've been you, ah-oh
It could've been you
