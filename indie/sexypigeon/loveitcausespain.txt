Love, It Causes Pain

Oh love, it causes pain
But she is not to blame for what I feel
It's not the same
As her

I've been falling, I feel weak since I last saw her
She doesn't notice me, she probably prefers a
A taller man, a better hand just to hold her
I need a plan to be the man that can call her

Love, it causes pain
But she is not to blame for what I feel
It's not the same
As her

If I could ask her out, what would be the outcome?
A double date and I show late to get the bread crumbs
We pack our bags and run away with our thumbs up
Or will I just crawl into the hole that I came from

Love, it causes pain
But she is not to blame for what I feel
It's not the same
As her
