Avocado Toast

Life goes so fast, I've been living so slow
Let's just leave, do whatever we want to
I don't want no regret
No any days

Let's set up, let's try to leave tomorrow
Wake up in the pier on the pacific coast
I don't want no regret
No any days

Life goes so fast, I've been living so slow
Holding on my past, I just wanna go
I don't want no regret
No any days

When we were at west, holding two french roses
Harlem tomatoes on avocado toast
I don't want no regrets
No any days

Life goes so fast, I've been living so slow
Let's just leave, do whatever we want to
I don't want no, I don't want no regret
Nor any days
