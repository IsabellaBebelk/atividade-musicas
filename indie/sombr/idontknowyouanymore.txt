i don't know you anymore

I watched you change
Now I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
I watched us fade
Now I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
Oh, your eyes are cold
And mine are crying for you
So much left to say
And little time to get through
You're on another path
While I'm stuck in the past
You're on another path
What's good can't ever last (oh)
(Ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah, ah) ah, ah
I watched you change
Now I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
I don't know you, I don't know you anymore
Oh, your eyes are cold
And mine are crying for you
So much left to say
And little time to get through
You're on another path
While I'm stuck in the past
You're on another path
What's good can't ever last
