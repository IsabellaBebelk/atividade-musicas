Back For More

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more, ayy
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, it all makes sense
And I know you don't feel no different
Whoa-ooh
There's a magic to how we livin'
There's a magic to what this is
It's like a dream and we both day-trippin'
Whoa-ooh

All I know is, if you walk away
There'll be something
There'll be things you can't replace
All I know is, if you walk away
There'll be something
Baby, that's okay, 'cause

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that door

I don't wanna feel nobody
If it isn't you, baby
Contigo, me pongo naughty
Been thinking about you lately
Ita, ita
Loco como mueve el culo Anitta
De todas, yo soy la favorita
Tú estás pa' mi y yo pa' ti todita
Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam
I know what you like, sing it like
Pa-pa-pam-pam, pam-pam-pam
Esto va a empezar (ooh)

All I know is, if you walk away
There'll be something (there'll be something)
Baby, that's okay, 'cause

I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that door

Ow, whoa
If you walk out the door
Ooh-ooh, ow
When I'm with you, when I'm with you

I can see you comin' back for more (comin' back for more)
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that door (no)
I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more (yeah)
If you walk out that—
