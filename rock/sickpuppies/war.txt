War

Let's do it
Faking falls
Stopping tall
Take it all
Fact is that I'm taking mine
I'm taking mine
Time is up
Out of luck
Should have stood up
But you're out of time
But you're out of time
Let's do this (fight, fight, fight)
Lock and load
Rock and roll
Bitch it's all over
You're going down
You're going down
Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
Cause it's time to remember it (war)
This is war
And it's on tonight
So get up and fight
Get up and fight
You had all your life
To run and hide
Step up, step up
Let's do this
Sat around
Going down
How about a little reaction, man?
You can barely stand
Bitch slap, slow attack
Man that was practically suicide
Next in line
(Go)
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

Get ready to settle the score
And get ready to face the floor
Cause it's time to remember it (war)
This is war
And it's on tonight
So get up and fight
Get up and fight
You had all your life
To run and hide
Step up, step up
Let's do this
Cause we're all about ready to break you all
And we're all about ready to break you all
Yeah we're all about ready to break you all
Yeah we're all about ready to break
This is war
And it never ends
So get up, get up, get up, get up!
You had all your life
To run and hide
Step up, so step up
This is war (and it never ends)
This is war (and it never ends)
This is war
Let's do this, let's do this, let's do this
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Let's do this
